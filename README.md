## Why this repo

Modern front-end development is getting much easier thanks to the thriving ecology of Javascript, there are so many frameworks and libraries that ease our pain of building web applications, but sometimes frameworks can be troublesome, they make your code harder to reason about. A true craftsman knows their tools well, and build one when tools in hand do not meet their needs. Framework code are just code, one effective way to learn it is to build a mvp version.
